# PoShSpeechRecognition
I didn't create this script but had to do a lot of digging to find. It is a speech recognition module that you can build pre-defined questions and ask PowerShell (while it is running) to find out the answers. Similar to Siri or Cortana but limited in its capacity to do much more than a handful of questions. I am sure with a little time a database could be compiled but since these functions are already out there its just something fun to play with. I didn't create this but I wanted to see another copy out there  WINDOWS SPEECH RECOGNITION MUST BE INSTALLED FOR THE SCRIPT TO RUN.
